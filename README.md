# Minimal and Simplified Tutorial on Hierarchical Density Based Spatial Clustering

**Abstract:** Hierarchical density based spatial clustering is a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm that is
widely used by the research community for the analysis of spatial data. This popularity is in part due to
its accessibility in well-known open-source libraries, which allow researchers to easily install and use the
algorithm for their use cases. Although easy to use, the underlying algorithmic steps are quite complex
and difficult to understand, which can lead to potential misuse or misinterpretation. Therefore, we aim to
provide a step-by-step explanation of the algorithmâ€™s underlying computations using a simple and minimal
two-dimensional example. Specifically, we guide the reader through the example by illustrating the steps
of density estimation, minimum spanning tree computation, hierarchy construction, and extraction of flat
clustering results. In addition, we provide notes on recent studies for further exploration by readers interested
in a deeper analysis of each step of the algorithm. We believe that this tutorial provides the reader with a
better understanding of the algorithm, helping them grasp both strengths and limitations of the algorithm
through a hands-on approach that can easily be reproduced with just pen and paper.
